MERN eCommerce Web Application
<p>Link to Live Site: http://18.236.93.230/</p>
A MERN Stack eCommerce project I built following Brad Traversy's MERN eCommerce from Scratch course on Udemy. I customized this project by changing the styling and products by making it a Herbal eCommerce page. I would like to add a feature that updates product stock when a order is made, and include a blog section.
<ul>
  <li>Users can order product and select the quantity.</li>
  <li>Users can view and manage their accounts and carts.</li>
  <li>This website is set up to accept paypal payments.</li>
  <li>Admin can manage users, products, and orders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I wanted to expand on my knowledge of MERN Full-Stack Development, and also learn about Redux.


<h2>Build status</h2>

  <li>Complete for now. Plan to return to this project to further customize it.</li>
  <li>Bug in window confirm needs to be fixed</li>
